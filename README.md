# To Run
## Online
visit https://fifadreamteam.000webhostapp.com/ to view the website

## Locally
The developers have independently been using different ways to run the code locally. One of the following ways is the following (assuming you already have Node installed)

### Installing
In terminal, type the following:

    npm install -g http-server

### Running
In your directory with the index.html file, type the following

    http-server -c-1

Then open up a browser (Chrome) and copy and paste the url given to you by running this command into the URL of the browser and you will see our system locally

# To Run Draft Page
Currently, there is an issue with connecting the Draft Page (React) with the rest of the pages, so for the moment you will have to view this page separately. To see how to do this, click on the DraftPageReact folder in the repository and follow that README.md file
